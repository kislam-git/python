**Project: To-Do List App (CLI)**

This project will help you learn about lists, loops, functions, and file handling in Python.

**Features:**

✅ Add a task

✅ View all tasks

✅ Remove a task

✅ Save tasks to a file (so they persist)

✅ Load tasks from a file on startup


**Step 1: Plan the Functions**

We'll break the program into small functions:

load_tasks(): Load tasks from a file

save_tasks(): Save tasks to a file

add_task(): Add a new task

remove_task(): Remove a task

view_tasks(): Display all tasks

main(): Runs the program loop

**Step 2: Implement the Code**

Check the main.py

**Step 3: How It Works**

The program loads tasks from tasks.txt (if it exists).
The user is shown a menu with options to:
  *  View tasks
  *  Add a task
  *  Remove a task
  *  Exit

When a task is added or removed, it updates the file.

The program runs in a loop until the user chooses to exit.
